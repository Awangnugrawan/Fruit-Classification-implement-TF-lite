# Fruit-Classification-implement-TF-lite

**Final Project Dicoding : Image Classification Model Deployment**

Clasification of 33 types of fruits using sequential Tensorflow model and Conv2D Maxpooling Layer. This dataset consists of 16854 images with a division of 80% train data and 20% test data.Overall after training has a train accuracy of> 92% and validation accuracy> 92%. This shows that the model created is a good fit and in the final stage the model is saved into TF-Lite format.
